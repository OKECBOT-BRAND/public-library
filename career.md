# Career Opportunities: Product Development Team at Okecbot

Welcome to the **Okecbot GitHub Organisation**! If you're a developer passionate about privacy-first automation, AI-driven workflows, and building tools that scale to browser profiles on a single machine, this is your place. 

Okecbot is the flagship Automation-as-a-Service platform of Dannyokec Cyber Security and Software Programming Limited (DCSSP), headquartered in Abuja, Nigeria. We empower digital entrepreneurs, agencies, and businesses to automate anything in their browser — safely, locally, at scale — without writing a single line of code.

Our mission is simple but deliberate: **give every user the power to automate anything, using AI agents, and never compromise privacy**. We're building the global standard for browser automation AI agent: one desktop app, one marketplace, one click to infinite browser automation.

As a new team member, you'll join a remote-first, async-by-default crew that's shipping the most powerful local-first automation platform ever built. You'll work directly on the core products:

Our architecture is deliberately decoupled for resilience and speed (full details in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)). Private repos include `okecbot-desktop-app`, `okecbot-web-api`, `okecbot-marketplace-client`, and more. We use GitHub for Issues, PRs, Projects, and Discussions — no Jira, no Slack spam.

We're small, focused, and intentional. Every line of code you write ships to 10,000+ users in 43 countries. If you're ready to own features end-to-end in a calm, high-trust environment, keep reading.
